## Overview and Origin

The name of my Company is Moov Financial 

Moov was incorporated in 2017.

* Who are the founders of the company? 
    * The founders of the Moov are Robert Smith and Wayne Arnold. Wayne had previously founded Banno, a similar company and BillGO, another Colorado based fintech company. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
    *  Here is a quote from Moov's website: "It all started when Wade picked up a Go Programming book to learn more about cloud computing. Next came our first OSS project. After a long bike ride while listening to Ludacris & a longer talk over margaritas, Wade & Bob set out to change the future of payments." While at jack Henry Wade Arnold saw that there needed to be not as many cores and ACH can be slow and it saught to help that process. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
    * So far the company has been through Series A funding and has raised 32.5 million dollars. Recently there was unattributed VC funding of 40 million dollars bringing the total to 72.5 million dollars. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
    *  Moov was started on Slack for open source coding to help Fintech companies figure and process payments. There was a gap in money transfers for coding they saught to solve that problem. The founders believed that every company would eventually need to have some sort of Fintech process to receive and send payments so they wanted to build those blocks for those companies. Their mission is "To eliminate the labyrinth of payments providers, we built the first all-in-one payments platform making it easy to accept, store, send, & spend money." Moov really takes the legacy technology and makes it easier and better for the end users to use for payments. It is really scaled to move money as scale. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
    * Moov targets developers at startups and other Fintech companies. They want to help the end users have ease of pay. It really can be as large as Moov wants it to be. Moov targets developers for any company moving into the fintech space but any company can really use the technology that Moov brings through its slack and API. Anyone that uses SaaS can be can use this embedded technology. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 
    * API, Golang, SQL, Python and JavaScript languages. They use AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Spark, Node.js, and docker as well. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?  
    * Moov is a payment platform company at its core. They really take on the ACH platforms. Moov has the technology to take store and release money all one one platform. They are two sided, compared to the others that may use Stripe to take money, store it at a local bank and then use another platform to release funds when need be. It is a banking company.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
    * Banks have been been around forever. Banking is huge nad there is a whole new offshoot in the space, enter Fintech. Fintech is an entire new domain and Moov seeks to be the bank for fintech. ACH has been around for a very long time too. There is a process to take and store money. Then there was another way to pay. Moov integrates this. They try to market to B2B and personal payments. There hasn't been a real ease to have money release and store. Digital Banking has revolutionized the way we live our lives. Modern bill pay a standard in banking now. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? 
    *  Moov is trying to streamline and bring pay rails together. The competitors are vast. Some of the similar companies doing similar things are Stripe, Dwolla, Square, Treasury Prime and Marketta. However Moov is also storing and releasing funds to in addition to those listed Moov also competes with local banks, and clearing houses. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 
    * They have a huge open source Slack and that is revolutionizing the embedded payment system for any company. Developers have flocked to the slack help so many companies embed their code. Moov make it easier to use a modern language for the existing technologies. Moov has one of the most hardened libraries that has been tested and proven. They have increase the "velocity of money." Same day capital can revolutionize how we do business. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
     * Moov's Slack has 16k users. That is not that many compared to other communities but if you look who is on that community it is the whos who of Fintech. Nineteen days ago Moov raised another 40 million in VC funding. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? 
    *  Moov is doing very well and because of the open source libraries its competitors actually run their code. Its interesting that Moov really believes to change the market and banking system, every one needs to share code to be successful. Wade Arnold is very community-centric and he sees a competitors success as his own. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 
    * It was be very neat to see move have a mobile presence. They focus on B2B and high volume but if they can do more personal payments they might be move visible to people outside of Fintech. If Moov can also move into the crypto space that would be the last piece of their full banking puzzel. I know that Plaid has been using cryptocurrencies and has been successful. Moov is authorized with Visa, Master, AMX, and Discover. This could have huge implications if you could pay credit with crypto. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
    * Moov does have wallets but it is not for crypto currieces. If Moov can offer crypto it can compete with a whole new sector of the Fintech banking space. They have the people and the APIs in place already. Immediately they would be a the forefront for dispurion and payments with crypto. Companies would be more inclined to bank with crypto is they use their harded and proven libraries too. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
     * Moov would have to use blockchain, new wallets, new APIs. I am sure this would also effect their clearing house status too. Because they are authorized to use Visa (other credit cards too) and are an clearinghouse they would need to use some reference to keep real time of pricing for crypto prices. I think it would be hard but because of their open source nature Moov could have community input to help out. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 
    * You have to use blockchain for cryptocurrencies. The other tech to price would have to be used to keep real time pricing to store the money. Your wallet would fluctuate even with no transactions.
